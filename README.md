 Recursive Descent Parser GUI

 This project implements a Recursive Descent Parser with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using `Tkinter`. It allows users to input grammar rules and a 
 string to parse, providing output that shows whether the string is accepted or rejected based on the given grammar.

  Features

- Input Grammar Rules: Users can input context-free grammar rules in the format `NonTerminal -> production1 | production2 | ...`.
- Input String: Users can input a string to check whether it can be parsed based on the provided grammar.
- Parse Check: The parser uses recursive descent to attempt parsing the input string according to the grammar.
- Grammar Simplicity Check: The program checks whether the grammar is simple (i.e., it does not contain left recursion).
- Output: Results are displayed in the output area, indicating whether the input string is accepted or rejected.

  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
